# QR Code Board Generater

QR Code Board Generator is a simple tool that creates a qr code go board position from a given text.

## History

QR code is invented by Masahiro Hara, and his team in 1994. He used to play go on his lunch breaks, and the design of the barcode system is influenced by the black and white stones on a go board. For the details of the story visit the article [The Little-Known Story of the Birth of the QR Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20200304140056/https://www.nippon.com/en/news/fnn20191214001/the-little-known-story-of-the-birth-of-the-qr-code.html).

## How to use

1. Install the required python [package(s).](./requirements.txt)
2. Run [qr_go_board.py](./qr_go_board.py), and enter the desired value for the qr code. This will create a usual qr code image named demo.png, a binary demonstration of the qr code in .txt format named demo.txt, and a smart game format (sgf) file named demo.sgf.
3. Use your favorite sgf viewer/editor to open demo.sgf file. If you do not have any installed sgf editor my suggestions are [GoWrite 2](https://gowrite.net/GOWrite2.html), and [Sabaki](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki).
